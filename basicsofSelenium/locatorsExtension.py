# After typing in "ind" what we get will be bunch of country names. So we wanted those country names to be stored in a variable, so that we can match with India and get it clicked.
# Assertion!!! because the page is not being refreshed after you typed in what you look for. how to assert then?
# So how we solved it; bcause value attribute of the section, is being updated constantly with your text. You can get the attribute value and compare it with India
